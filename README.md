### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="27" />

I'm [**Nishevitha**](https://www.nishevithavenkatesh.com/), a third-year computer science student building software in Canada. 

I’m currently working on AI/ML systems at [**Morgan Stanley**](https://github.com/morganstanley) this winter, after previously interning there as a full-stack engineer. I’m interested in building production-ready software and shipping reliable systems with real-world impact.

Outside of coursework and internships, I’m passionate about building the tech community. We created a space called [**WATT Wire**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/w-a-t-t-wire/), a weekly micro-publication focused on technical breakdowns, engineering thinking, and conversations with women in tech across various industries. 

I also speak at conferences, panels, and workshops on topics ranging from DevOps culture to blockchain, AI, and emerging technologies. I hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and enjoy learning in public through writing, speaking, and mentoring.
